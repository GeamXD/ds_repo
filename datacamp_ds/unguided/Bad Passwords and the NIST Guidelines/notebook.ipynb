Even more concerning, 59% of Americans have incorporated personal information, such as their name or birthday, into their password. This makes it unsurprising that 4 in 10 Americans have had their personal information compromised online. Passwords with commonly used phrases and personal information makes cracking a password drastically easier.</p>\n","<p>You may have noticed over the years that password requirements have increased in complexity, including recommendations to change your passwords every couple of months. Compiled from industry recommendations, below is a list of passwords requirements you will be asked to test: </p>\n","<p><strong>Password Requirments:</strong></p>\n","<ol>\n","<li>Must be at least 10 characters in length</li>\n","<li>Must contain at least:<ul>\n","<li>one lower case letter </li>\n","<li>one upper case letter </li>\n","<li>one numeric character </li>\n","<li>one non-alphanumeric character</li></ul></li>\n","<li>Must not contain the phrase <code>password</code> (case insensitive)</li>\n","<li>Must not contain the user's first or last name, e.g., if the user's name is <code>John Smith</code>, then <code>SmItH876!</code> is not a valid password.</li>\n","</ol>\n","<p>Here is the dataset that you will investigate this project:</p>\n","<div style=\"background-color: #ebf4f7; color: #595959; text-align:left; vertical-align: middle; padding: 15px 25px 15px 25px; line-height: 1.6;\">\n","    <div style=\"font-size:20px\"><b>datasets/logins.csv</b></div>\n","Each row represents a login credential.
