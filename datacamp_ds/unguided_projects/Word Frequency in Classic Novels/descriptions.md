#Project Description
In this Project, you'll scrape a novel from the website Project Gutenberg (which contains a large corpus of books) using the Python package requests. Then you'll extract words from this web data using BeautifulSoup. Finally, we'll dive into analyzing the distribution of words using the Natural Language ToolKit (nltk).

The natural language processing tools used here apply to much of the data that data scientists encounter as a vast proportion of the world's data is unstructured data and includes a great deal of text. To complete this Project, you need to know how to import web data into Python and how to work with natural language text.

## Instructions
Welcome to the Python project Word Frequency in Peter Pan!
Peter and Wendy are the main protagonists of the story: after all, Wendy goes back to grow up, and Peter stays as child forever in Neverland. But there are many other characters that take part to their adventures.

Your question is as follows:

1. Among the top ten most common meaningful words in the text, which ones are character names? Save your answer as a variable protagonists in the form of a list of strings (e.g. ["Gandalf", "Dumbledore", "Yoda"]).

The method through which you approach this question is up to you, but one thing to keep in mind is that the words like the, me, him are not considered meaningful, and may require to be removed before processing with counting.
