The company recently ran a wine promotion in Saint Petersburg that was very successful. Due to the cost to the business, it isn‚Äôt possible to run the promotion in all regions. The marketing team would like to target 10 other regions that have similar buying habits to Saint Petersburg where they would expect the promotion to be similarly successful.\n\n### The data\nThe marketing team has sourced you with historical sales volumes per capita for several different drinks types.\n\n- \"year\" - year (1998-2016)\n- \"region\" - name of a federal subject of Russia. It could be oblast, republic, krai, autonomous okrug, federal city and a single autonomous oblast\n- \"wine\" - sale of wine in litres by year per capita\n- \"beer\" - sale of beer in litres by year per capita\n- \"vodka\" - sale of vodka in litres by year per capita\n- \"champagne\" - sale of champagne in litres by year per capita\n- \"brandy\" - sale of brandy in litres by year per capita","metadata":{"id":"bA5ajAmk7XH6"},"id":"aboriginal-address","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"import pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_csv(r'./data/russian_alcohol_consumption.csv')\ndf.head()","metadata":{},"id":"labeled-fourth","cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>year</th>\n","      <th>region</th>\n","      <th>wine</th>\n","      <th>beer</th>\n","      <th>vodka</th>\n","      <th>champagne</th>\n","      <th>brandy</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>1998</td>\n","      <td>Republic of Adygea</td>\n","      <td>1.9</td>\n","      <td>8.8</td>\n","      <td>3.4</td>\n","      <td>0.3</td>\n","      <td>0.1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>1998</td>\n","      <td>Altai Krai</td>\n","      <td>3.3</td>\n","      <td>19.2</td>\n","      <td>11.3</td>\n","      <td>1.1</td>\n","      <td>0.1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>1998</td>\n","      <td>Amur Oblast</td>\n","      <td>2.1</td>\n","      <td>21.2</td>\n","      <td>17.3</td>\n","      <td>0.7</td>\n","      <td>0.4</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>1998</td>\n","      <td>Arkhangelsk Oblast</td>\n","      <td>4.3</td>\n","      <td>10.6</td>\n","      <td>11.7</td>\n","      <td>0.4</td>\n","      <td>0.3</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>1998</td>\n","      <td>Astrakhan Oblast</td>\n","      <td>2.9</td>\n","      <td>18.0</td>\n","      <td>9.5</td>\n","      <td>0.8</td>\n","      <td>0.2</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["   year              region  wine  beer  vodka  champagne  brandy\n","0  1998  Republic of Adygea   1.9   8.8    3.4        0.3     0.1\n","1  1998          Altai Krai   3.3  19.2   11.3        1.1     0.1\n","2  1998         Amur Oblast   2.1  21.2   17.3        0.7     0.4\n","3  1998  Arkhangelsk Oblast   4.3  10.6   11.7        0.4     0.3\n","4  1998    Astrakhan Oblast   2.9  18.0    9.5        0.8     0.2"]},"execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}]},{"source":"## üí™ Competition challenge\n\n1.
